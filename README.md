This code explores the merger of two globuar clusters. 

Firstly, the two globular clusters in the system are set up and merged in 'GC Initial Merger.py'. The relevant final states of all particles in the system (position, velocity, acceleration, mass, etc) of the resultant cluster are saved and stored.

If you want to merge the resultant cluster with another globular cluster, run the file 'GC Repeated Merger.py'. This uses the stored states from 'GC Initial Merger.py' to merge the cluster with another new cluster.
Once again, the final states of particles are saved and stored. Run this file again to merge the resultant cluster with another cluster. 

You can use the 'data analysis 2.py' and 'mass plot combo.py' files to analyse the particle data gathered from the GC mergers. 
Such analysis includes the mass distribution (segregation) across the cluster after each merger, the mass of the black holes throughout the simulation, and the number of mergers required to form an intermediate-mass black hole.
